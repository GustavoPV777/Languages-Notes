HTML is a markup language composed by a set of elements that are the basis of its structure. These elements conform a toolbox authors can use to shape their documents.

An HTML element is usually composed by two tags: the opening tag and the closing tag. An opening tag consists of the element's name encolsed by the lesser-than "<" and greater-than ">" signs. The closing tag is constructed like the opening tag but, in this case, the element's name is preceded by a slash ("/").

The HTML tags follow an order such as the example bellow:

~~~
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Your Title Here</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<a> A Link Here </a>

<H1>This is a Header</H1>
<H2>This is a Medium Header</H2>

<P> This is a new paragraph!
<P> This is a new paragraph!</P> 

</BODY>
</HTML>
